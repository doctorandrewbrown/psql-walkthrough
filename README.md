### Useful postgresql terminal commands
```bash
$ set_pg # tell terminal we are using postgresql (at main prompt)
$ psql # call postgresql prompt (at main prompt)
\l # list postgresql databases in file (psql prompt)
\c chinook # connect to chinook db (for example)
\dt # display tables in connected db
\q # quit psql prompt
ctrl+z # exit table list etc
```
### For the error below restart workspace in gitpod dashboard

```bash
psql: error: connection to server at "127.0.0.1", port 5432 failed: Connection refused
        Is the server running on that host and accepting TCP/IP connections?
```
